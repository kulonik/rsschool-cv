## About me:

I'm interested in studying anything new. Before programming languages I had been learning foreign languages such English, Italian, French and Turkish. I know some of them more than couple of phrases. My working path was long and too crooked.

First I was an English teacher at a secondary school, after that I worked at the radio plant as a technical translator. Later I worked at the pawnshop and at the private security company. Now I am at the bank but would like to change my career.

Probably I will be able to find a job in a different department at the same bank or to go to another place.
